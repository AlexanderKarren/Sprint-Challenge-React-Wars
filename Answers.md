1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a Javasript Library that allows you to code JSX alongside javascript with many components, so you don't have to individually select elements in order to make a site interactive.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

To think about your websites in terms of reusable, interactive components separated by files, rather than using a long javascript sheep with query selectors and event listeners.

3. Describe state.

State is the part of the program that can change based on user interaction. Every time the state is updated, the elements re-render.

4. Describe props.

Props are inherited variables, state or otherwise, that you can pass from component to component.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

A side effect is a state change that occurs outside a specified variable, ie an effect that triggers when a document is loaded.
